- [ ] `components/ResponsiveImage.tsx` - Have run an optimizer script on the images but now going to the drawings or photos pages, the images are scaled wrong and are displayed too large on the screen. Tried to not manually change their size with fill = {true} but this causes the images not to render at all on screen.
